== Writing Targeted Policies for SELinux on Red Hat Enterprise Linux

This course teaches the development of SELinux policies that extend the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) *targeted* policy set. It focuses on developing SELinux policies with the help of development tooling included in RHEL, especially the *sepolicy generate* and *audit2allow* commands.

== Audience

System Administrators, Site Reliability Engineers, Application Developers, and other IT professionals responsible for securing applications running on Linux servers.

== Prerequisites

Learners are expected to have have some familiarity with managing SELinux on RHEL. If you need a refresher on these tasks, please review the following Red Hat Training Courses:

== Classroom Environment

For now, there is no virtual labs for performing hands-on activities. You just need a RHEL server or VM to which you have root access and from which can download RPM packages from Red Hat repositories or a Yum mirror.

As course development progresses, some Red Hat Training course classroom or Red Hat Demo workshop environment will be selected as ready-to-use environments for hands-on activities.

You could even try these activities directly on your day-to-day machine if you're feeling brave ;-) because the worst consequence of trivial mistales would be waiting a few minutes to relabel the root partition at boot.

== Other Sources of Information About SELinux

Of course, the ultimate sources of information about SELinux are the Red Hat Enterprise Linux product documentation and the upstream from the Fedora Project and the SELinux project.
