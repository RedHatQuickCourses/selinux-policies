= Extending SELinux Policies

Goal::

Create a custom SELinux policy module to extend the RHEL targeted policy set for a new confined domain.

WARNING: Work in Progress

== Introduction

This chapter concludes this course by walking though the scenario of creating a new policy module for a compiled application, so it runs as a confined domain from the System daemon.

Using the knowledge from previous chapters about interpreting SELinux policy rules and AVC errors, we follow an interative workflow to build a policy module in a semi-automated fashion using the tooling provided by RHEL.
