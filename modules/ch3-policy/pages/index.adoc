= Extending SELinux Policies

Goal::

Create a custom SELinux policy module to extend the RHEL-targeted policy set for a new confined domain.

== Introduction

This chapter concludes this course by walking through the scenario of creating a new policy module for a compiled application, so it runs as a confined domain from the System Daemon.

Using the knowledge from previous chapters about interpreting SELinux policy rules and AVC errors, we will follow an interactive workflow to build a policy module in a semi-automated fashion using the tooling provided by Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
