= Create a Custom SELinux Policy

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Understand the process of creating a custom SELinux policy module using the tools from RHEL.

== A Semi-Automated Policy Creation Process

Red Hat recommends that you create a custom SELinux policy module by following this process:

1. Generate a stater policy module using the `sepolicy generate` command.
2. Build and load the autogenerated policy module
3. Run the application in permissive mode, as set by the autogenerated policy module.
4. Interact with the application, so it creates AVC errors in the audit log.
5. Feed AVC errors to the `audit2allow` command, and merge the resulting policies into the autogenerated policy module.
6. Go back to (2), repeating the process until you exercised all features of the application and get no more AVC errors.
7. Remove the permissive flag from the autogenerated policy module.
8. Perform a final build and load of the policy module and extensive tests of the application in enforcing mode.

The `audit2allow` command comes from the same `policycoreutils-python-utils` package which provides the `audit2why` command which we used in the previous chapter. The `sepolicy` command comes from the `policycoreutils-devel` package.

At each iteration of the process, you must exercise care that you don't add rules which make your policy module too lenient and give too much power to your application. This means you need knowledge about the target application (what it does and what it needs) and of the RHEL targeted policy set (which types, attributes, and rules it provides).

== Generate a Policy Module

The `sepolicy generate` command offers command-line options to generate a starter policy for different kinds of applications:

[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
--
$ *sepolicy generate --help*
...
positional arguments:
  command               executable to confine
...
Policy types which require a command:
  --application         Generate 'User Application' policy
  --cgi                 Generate 'Web Application/Script (CGI)' policy
  --dbus                Generate 'DBUS System Daemon' policy
  --inetd               Generate 'Internet Services Daemon' policy
  --init                Generate 'Standard Init Daemon' policy
...
--

Depending on the type of the application, it will introspect the `command` file as an executable file and try to guess a set of default policies based on the expected behavior of the type of application.

For example, for regular system services which run as Systemd services, you should use the "Standard Init Daemon" policy (option `--init`) which generates:

* New types for the application domain and for application executable, runtime, and data/configuration/log files.
* A transition rule from the `init_t` domain type to the application domain type.
* Allow rules for the application file types.

This policy module requires additional allow rules for any and all tasks the application performs, for example:

* Open network connections.
* Access system files.
* Access user files.
* Access device files.

Depending on the complexity of the application, it may require additional domain and resource types.

== Policy Module Sources and Build Script

A typical policy module, as generated by the `sepolicy generate` command, includes the following source files:

* `command.if` - defines interfaces, types, and attributes.
* `command.fc` - defines the security context for application files.
* `command.te` - contains allow rules and domain transition rules.
* `command_selinux.spec` - RPM package specification.

Most of the work on completing an autogenerated policy module happens on the *type enforcement* file (the `.te` file), by adding more rules.

The `sepolicy generate` command also generates a build script, named `command.sh`, which performs the following tasks:

* Builds a binary policy module named `command.pp`.
* Loads the binary policy module.
* Generates a man page for the policy module, based on comments in its *interface file* (the `command.if` file).
* Packages the binary policy module and its interface file in an RPM package.
* Packages the policy source files in an SRPM package.

At each iteration of the policy creation process, you run the build script again to rebuild and reload your custom policy module, and then restart your application to check for new or remaining AVC errors under the updated policy.

== The Test Application

The third-party application we use in the next few activities is the same one we used in a xref:ch1-need:s6-confined-lab.adoc[previous activity], named `testapp`, and it is designed to run either as a system service or as an interactive application.

If you start the test application as a system service, it performs the following tasks:

* Create a PID file, as it is typical for system services.
* Read from the `/proc/meminfo` virtual file.
* Connect to https://wttr.in/ in a loop, for a hard-coded list of cities. These are cities with Red Hat offices.
* Log messages into the system log (journald).

It does the same tasks every time, not requiring any user input or listening for network requests. And, once it finishes the list of cities, it terminates.

The https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/selinux-policies-samples/tree/main/testapp[source code] of the test application is available, if you are curious, but you don't need it in order to create its custom SELinux policy.

== Next Steps

The following four activities create a custom policy module for the test application, by following the interactive process outline in this section. In between each activity, there's a short presentation section which explains additional aspects of developing SELinux policy modules, starting with policy interfaces.
