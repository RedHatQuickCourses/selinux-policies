= SELinux Management

Goal::

Configure SELinux targeted policies for RHEL packages

== Introduction

This chapter reviews tools provided by RHEL that support managing and troubleshooting SELinux policies. It provides a couple of case studies of Apache Web Server with typical configuration changes and a PHP application.

These same tools will be used in the next chapter to create and validate custom policies for third-party applications on a RHEL.
