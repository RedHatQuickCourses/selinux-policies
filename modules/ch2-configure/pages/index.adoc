This chapter reviews tools provided with RHEL that support managing and toubleshooting SELinux policies. It provides a couple case studies of Apache Web Server with typical configuration changes.

These same tools will be used in the next chapter to create and validate custom policies for a sample application that you will deploy on a RHEL machine.
