= Consistent SElinux settings

_Estimated reading time: *{time_estimate} minutes*._

Objective::

Ensure consistent SELinux settings on multiple servers using Ansible collections.

WARNING: Pending Review

// Check for a supported system role

// Mention consistency between dev, test, and production; or multiple data centers running the same apps (multiple copies of the same servers)

== The Need to Automate SELinux Configuration

Configuring SELinux in one RHEL machine is not hard nor very time consuming, but you usually have to configure SELinux in multiple machines, and also ensure those machines stay configured the way you wish over time.

Even if your SELinux configuration seem to be specific to a given application, that application is probably deployed into multiple machines from: 

* Development, testing and production environments;
* Disaster recovery sites;
* Multiple branch offices;
* Different cloud provider regions;

And the list could go on.

The solution is automation, and Red Hat uses https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible[Ansible] to automate multile products, including RHEL. This course does not teach the fundamentals of Ansible, but it provides working examples on which you can build upon for your real world environments.

== The SELinux System Role from RHEL

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) provides a number of Ansible roles for common system administration tasks, such as installing packages and managing firewall settings. These are named https://access.redhat.com/articles/3050101[RHEL System Roles] and belong to a single RPM package named `rhel-system-roles`.

The https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html-single/automating_system_administration_by_using_rhel_system_roles/index#introduction-to-the-selinux-system-role_configuring-selinux-using-system-roles[SELinux System Role] performs common SELinux administration tasks, from enabling SELinux to loading policy modules.

Like other system roles, the SELinux system role require that a playbook sets a number of variables, them performs actions based on the values of those variables. If a variable is unset, them the role does nothing.

You can find a list of all variables from the SELinux system role and their purposes on the sample files from the system roles RPM package itself or on the upstrem https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/standalone/roles/linux-system-roles/selinux/documentation/[Linux System Roles] Ansibe collection.

The SELinux system roles and other RHEL system role can be used by themselves, in narrow purpose playbooks, or in larger playbooks which perform all tasks required to deploy and configure an application.  

In fact, the https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/using-system-tags-enable-extended-security-hardening-recommendations[Red Hat Insights Security Advisor] service uses RHEL system roles in its remediation playbooks to increase security of systems it finds with SELinux disabled or in permissive move, if you enable Red Hat Insights extended security hardening.

== Next Steps

We will wrap up this chapter with working examples of Ansible playbooks which configure SELinux for the two previous use cases of a PHP application and an Apache web server with non-standard settigs. Then we start the final chapter of this course by creating a custom policy module for a compiled application.

=== Ansible collections: slides #129-133

We have properly configured SELinux on one system, what about others?

Letâ€™s use ansible to deploy the same configuration to the rest of the servers!

use the following Ansible role:

Expected Functionality:

Set enforcing/permissive
restorecon portions of filesystem tree
Set/Get Booleans
Set/Get file contexts
Manage logins
Manage ports
