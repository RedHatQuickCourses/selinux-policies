= Review of SELinux

Goal::

Understand the need for custom SELinux targeted policies.

== Introduction

This chapter reviews the purpose of SELinux and its day-to-day administration tasks with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It aims to help IT professionals assess if they should just use the policies provided by Red Hat and other vendors as they are, or if they need to develop custom policies to protect their applications and users.

This chapter also shows how to read and interpret SELinux policies using examples from RHEL system services, laying the foundation for you to create and validate your own custom policies.
