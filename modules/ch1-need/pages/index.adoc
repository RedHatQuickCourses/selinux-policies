== Introduction

This chapter reviews the purpose of SELinux and related day-to-day administration tasks with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) with the purpose of helping IT professional assess if they should just use the policies provided by Red Hat and other vendors, as they are, or if they need to develop custom policies to protect their applications and users.
